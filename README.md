# Sorting Visualiser

A tool to help visualise how different sorting algorithms work.
* Splits a random image into a 5x5 grid, shuffles the grid and starts sorting.
* Number of comparisons are displayed to give an estimate of how efficient an algorithm is.
* Fullscreen mode to hide the UI and enjoy the sorting.
