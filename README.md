# Sorting Visualizer

You pick a r x c image
every pixel is labelled from 1 to (r * c)
then randomised (show the image generated from randomised pixels)
now we start sorting
while sorting we add a border to each pixel for better visualizationand also make them like 90% of original size
you can set the speed to 0.25x or 0.5x or 2x
and in the end the image is regenerated
